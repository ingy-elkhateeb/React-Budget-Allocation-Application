# My Budget planner

This React Budget Allocation Application was developed as a project during my course Journey "Developing Front-End Apps with React",offered by IBM. It is a React application that helps an individual manage his Budget by adding and editing an initial Budget, Adding Expenses like shopping, appointments,etc and specify the expense amount. After each expense, the application calculates and displays the remaining budget for better experience.

## Add Expense
You can manage your expenses in the budget planner application by adding new expenses as long as it doesn't exceeds the budget. When a new expense is added the application automatically calculates the spent and the remaining amounts and display them. Here is a screenshot showing the add expense process before and after.

## Edit Your Budget
To make the application more flexible I developed an editable Budget where you can edit your budget and the remaining value will be calculated accordingly.<br>

## Delete an Expense
Also for more flexability, you can delete an expense and the spent and remaining amounts will be calculated and displayed accordingly.In this Screenshot I deleted the groceries expense which costed $200 and hence the spent decreased by 200 while the remaining increased by 200. <br>
